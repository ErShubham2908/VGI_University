## Tag 
    An HTML tag is a snippet of code that defines an element within an HTML document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >), and they usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
## Attributes
    HTML attributes provide additional information about an element and are specified within the opening tag of the element.
## Content 
    The content of an HTML element is the information contained between the opening and closing tags (if present). It can include text, other nested elements, images, multimedia, etc. For instance, in <p>Hello, World!</p>, "Hello, World!" is the content of the paragraph (<p>) element.
## Element 
    An HTML element is a part of a webpage. It consists of a start tag, some content, and an end tag, if applicable. Elements are the building blocks of HTML documents and define the structure and content of a webpage. For example, <p> is the start tag for a paragraph element, and </p> is the end tag.
